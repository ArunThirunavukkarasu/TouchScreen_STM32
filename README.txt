This is another version of the original Adafruit library, ported for STM32.
Not perfect but is simple, very fast and reliable.
Should be used in conjunction with the TFTLCD library.

Features:
- mapping of the coordinate ranges to the display resolution (default: 240*320)
- semi-automatic (user-assisted) easy calibration process (requires touching two opposite corners).
- repeated touch
- double click/touch
